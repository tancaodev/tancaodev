\lettersection{About Me}
I graduated from Ton Duc Thang University with a major in Computer Networks and Data Communications. Although my academic focus was on networking, I developed a strong passion for software development during my studies, which I’ve since pursued as a career.

I have one year of experience as a Frontend Developer at Meowcart Ecommerce, a Shopify-focused startup. I applied my web programming and data communication skills to develop scalable and secure web applications. I contributed to projects for well-known brands in Vietnam such as Crocs, FitFlop, SEESON, and TheVapeClub. Notably, I led the Crocs Loyalty project and helped build a Shopify-integrated app allowing users to log in with phone numbers and receive OTPs via Zalo or SMS.

While my strengths are in frontend development, I’m actively working toward becoming a Full Stack Developer. I take courses on Udemy and Coursera to improve programming and system design skills, and I’m currently preparing for the AWS certification.

\lettersection{Why [Company]?}
I truly admire the company’s products as well as its strong commitment to personal and professional development. (I believe your solutions make coding more accessible for beginners, which is something I deeply respect. Working at your company would give me the opportunity to contribute to improving current products, making them more engaging and user-friendly, and to participate in the development of future projects.) I hope to apply my skills in web development, problem-solving, and system design to create meaningful impact.

Moreover, your employee policies and benefits make me confident that this is an environment where I can grow sustainably — where collaboration is encouraged and individual potential is recognized. Last but not least, the chance to work alongside talented colleagues at your company excites me, as it would allow me to contribute my skills while also learning and growing professionally.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I’m someone who’s always eager to learn and apply new knowledge to real-world projects. This mindset fuels my professional growth — whether solving technical issues at work or building side projects on GitHub. It’s also what inspired me to apply after reading your job description. And I believe my self-driven learning, hands-on experience, and strong curiosity align well with the role. I’m confident I can bring value to your team while continuing to grow in a dynamic and innovative environment.

I am looking forward to hearing from you and thank you for your consideration.
